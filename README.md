# MachineLearning

Welcome to my Machine Learning journey! In this repository, I have documented and shared a collection of lessons and exercises that explore key concepts in machine learning and deep learning, along with the necessary tools and techniques used in the field. Below is an overview of each lesson covered in the notebooks.

This introductory notebook sets the foundation for understanding machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). It explains the importance of these fields in modern AI applications and provides an overview of what the upcoming lessons will cover. We will also define essential concepts like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and model evaluation.

## How to Use this Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/username/MachineLearning.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd MachineLearning`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks:
  a. Install Jupyter if you haven't already: `pip install notebook` <br /> 
  b. Start the Jupyter server: `jupyter notebook` <br /> 
4. Open each notebook to explore the lessons and exercises
5. OR simply, change the domain from 'github.com' to 'githubtocolab.com'. The notebook will open in Colab.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to get started with machine learning and deep learning. Each notebook covers foundational topics and practical techniques that you can apply to real-world data science problems. Happy learning!
