    "* Practice, Practice, Practice: Machine learning is a hands-on discipline. The more you code, experiment with different algorithms, and analyze datasets, the better you’ll understand the concepts.\n",
    "* Projects: Start with small projects like predicting house prices, classification of images, or sentiment analysis before tackling more complex tasks.\n",
    "* Consistency: Set aside regular time to learn, solve problems, and build projects. \n",
